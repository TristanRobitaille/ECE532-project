LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_1_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_1_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/playback_data[11]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/timebase_clk_reg/CLR, design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/timebase_counter_reg[0]/CLR, design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/timebase_counter_reg[10]/CLR, design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/timebase_counter_reg[11]/CLR, design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/timebase_counter_reg[12]/CLR, design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/timebase_counter_reg[13]/CLR, design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/timebase_counter_reg[14]/CLR, design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/timebase_counter_reg[15]/CLR, design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/timebase_counter_reg[1]/CLR, design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/timebase_counter_reg[2]/CLR, design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/timebase_counter_reg[3]/CLR, design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/timebase_counter_reg[4]/CLR, design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/timebase_counter_reg[5]/CLR, design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/timebase_counter_reg[6]/CLR, design_1_i/mic_storage_0/inst/timebase_counter_reg[7]/CLR (the first 15 of 17 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning

The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
